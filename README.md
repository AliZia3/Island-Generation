## How to run the product

To Get Grid Mesh: In Generator --> java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh grid
To Get Irregular Mesh: In Generator --> java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh irregular [number vertices] [relax value number]

To run without debug mode: In Visualizer --> java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg 
To run with debug mode: In Visualizer --> java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg -X 

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one.

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes one single argument (so far), the name of the file where the generated mesh will be stored as binary.

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh grid (provides grid mesh)
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh irregular [number vertices] [relax value number] (provides irregular mesh)
mosser@azrael generator % ls -lh sample.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator %
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments (so far): the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg (in normal mode)
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg -X (in debug mode)

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael visualizer % ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer %
```

To viualize the SVG file:

-   Open it with a web browser
-   Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.
