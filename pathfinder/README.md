### Rationale:

The rationale for this project lies in providing a tool for urbanists to better understand and plan for the development of urban landscapes. This project aims to leverage the ability to transform meshes into maps to create a more realistic representation/simulation of the islands and their urban landscapes.

### Explanation for extending library by implementing a new algorithm:

To simulate the development of cities and a road network on the generated terrain, we need to be able to find paths between nodes. Thus, we need to extend the library by implementing a new algorithm that can find the shortest path between nodes. By implmenting the algorithm we can simulate the establishment of cities and the development of road networks to connect them. This will enable us to create a more realistic simulation of island countries.
